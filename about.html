    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I'm a vegan baker local to the Philadelphia area. My name is Leo, and I've been vegan for quite a few years at this point. I initially got interested in baking because my mom and grandmother were avid bakers, but I got even more interested when I went vegan and realized that there weren't any baked goods available for me! I pride myself on making baked goods that are good enough for everyone to enjoy and I've even gotten rave reviews from meat eaters (not that we care about their opinion amiright [chill carnivores it's jokes ofc]).</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Furthermore, I'm a computer and electrical engineer so I coded this whole website myself including the sourdough calculator because I believe in making baking as accessible as possible for everyone. Purchasing from me is only if you have extra resources and want to taste what it's like from the source! This means that I'm MORE than happy to post any recipes and if you're interested in trying them just let me know and I'll add them to this website! I haven't gotten around to it because I haven't seen the interest for it. Maybe by the time you're reading this I've posted some of them already :o.</p>
